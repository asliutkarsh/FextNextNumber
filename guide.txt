# Fext-Next-Number-Api

This is a sample Spring Boot application that provides an API to fetch the next number for a given category code.
It also provides an API to check if the digit sum of a number is equal to one.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, you need to have the following installed:

- JDK 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

Clone the repository or download the source code from :

Navigate to the project directory:

    cd FextNextNumber

Build the project:

## Usage

### Fetching the Next Number

To fetch the next number for a given category code, send a POST request to the /numbers endpoint with the following request body:

    {
        "categoryCode": "test"
    }

Replace test with the category code for which you want to fetch the next number.

The response will be a JSON object with the following structure:

    {
        "oldValue": 10L,
        "newValue": 19L
    }
